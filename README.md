# Capstone_project


This project is my third project in the NYCDSA Data Analytics program. 

Liquor sales in Iowa are unique such that all liquor must go through the state. Once manufactured, it goes to state facilities to be priced then sent back to retailers. 

The data used contains over 23M rows and 24 columns. These columns provide store, vendor, liquor, and price infomation for every transaction. 

Polk county is the most populous county in Iowa and their best seller of liquor is whiskey. My project looks at the price sensitivity of whiskey sale across three grocery stores (Hy-Vee, Walmart and Target) in Polk county.
